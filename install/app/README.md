# apps
This folder contains subfolders named after each character's NFC ID (hex code).
Some notes:
* Each subfolder will contain a shell script which launches some kind of app
(usually an emulator program).
* Non-supported Amiibo figures simply do not have a subfolder with their
hex code. See `Adding Apps to amiibrOS` below for information on how to add
apps for your Amiibo figures.
